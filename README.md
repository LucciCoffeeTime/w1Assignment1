# WEEK 3 - PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT


### INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES

This program is a combatant documentor. Imagine a video game recently launched and a vague amount of information exists about the enemies throughout the game. This program is a way to document information about an encountered foe. (THIS PROGRAM IS LIMITED TO WEEK 3 TEACHINGS SO SOME INCONVIENCES LIKE HAVING TO RESTART THE PROGRAM FOR NOT USING A CORRECT VARIABLE IS PRESENT IN ABUNDANCE)



(STEP 1): The program will ask the user which video game they are currently playing.
- In a larger program, this would be ideal to document multiple games and expand its usage throughout communities.

(STEP 2): The program will ask the user the race of the enemy they encountered/are currently facing.
- This is a means to categorize properly and prepare to document the next pieces of information.

(STEP 3): The program will ask the user for the classification of the enemy.
- Some enemies in video games have different models and actions based on its clasificiation. For example, a boss could have 20 actions and 100 health compared to a minor combatant that could have simply 5 health and only 1 action. In the case of this program the minors will have 25 health.

(STEP 4): The program will ask the user for the amount of health the enemy had when it was encountered.
- Please follow the instructures and give proper inputs otherwise the program will error and end.
- Once the value is given a difference will be calculated to document what health the enemy had when he used certain actions. Some enemies in video games will have actions that only become usable when it reaches a certain threshhold of remaining health. For this program there will be no extra actions.

(STEP 5): The program will ask the user to input 4 observed actions for the enemy.
- This is a crucial part of the documentation alongside other pieces of information. Information is power and dominion over the enemies. The more you know about an enemy, the higher the chance you will have to clear the fight.

(STEP 6): The program will ask the user to input ranges for each enemy action provided.
- These ranges not only inform players of the distance each action can cover, but also allows a safe distance to be calculated and recommended.

(STEP 7): The program will open a file named "report.txt" and write a pretty summary of all information provided and the calculated values (this acts as a form of documentation).
- In an actual full program, before writing the summary, this would prompt the user to verify the information and make appropriate changes.

(CONCLUSION): The program will output a MENU to the user that offers 3 choices.
- 1: TO VIEW THE SUMMARY
- 2: TO REVIEW ALL USER INPUTS
- 3: TO END THE PROGRAM
- if an incorrect option is chosen or a wrong variable value is given the program will end with an error.

Thank you for viewing my program. I hope to expand on enemy dicision structures in the future.

## AN IDEA OF WHAT THE PROGRAM MIGHT FEATURE IN THE FUTURE IF WE ARE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE WORKING ON IT
Eventually, I want this program to be more accessible to user input and be able to document more information. Features like action-health-gates, speeds, location, relocation, and more might be added. However, I am very limited right now due to not being able to use loops. Eventually, I want to gain a full understanding of how decision structures work. Coding this program is my way to understand it.
